Video1:
From the video, I understood that LangSmith provides observability into AI applications through a feature called tracing. It creates a detailed log, or a run tree, of every step your application takes, from the initial input to the final output. This makes it simple to debug issues and analyze performance by looking at metrics like latency for each step in the process.

Tweaking:
Imported and Added tracing to every function and asked llm about other methods of tracing, what type of metadata can I add?, an example of adding metadat during runtime
